# Automatic Greenhouse

The goal for this project week was to make a fully functioning automated greenhouse, where all funtions that would need manual work, would be able to be done by the greenhouse.

## Arduino

We used Arduino a hardware and software platform. Arduino has these mini computers. Where not a lot of space is needed and it is possible to code what they do.

We first got used to the Arduino Nano 33 

Then we decided what we needed for a automated greenhouse.

After that we looked at the humidity sensor, which we calibrated by seeing how much was returned with it's value in a glas of water, and the value when it was in the open. Then using those information we calibrated the sensor.

Subsequently we began with the work with the relay, which we needed because the Arduino itself can't provide sufficient voltage. Here we firstly tried to understand it by using it not connected to anything and after connected to the water pump. Then we saw that the tube of the water pump was too long and cut a bit off. What we wanted to see was how much water would come out after a certain time and we decided that two seconds was the best time for watering the mint plant.

It was decided that we use GitHub so that we can work on the same file somewhat at the same time.
